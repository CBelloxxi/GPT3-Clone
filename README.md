# Modern UI/UX GPT-3 Landing Page
This is a GPT-3 Landing Page built with a Modern UI/UX using React JS. It encompasses all modern UX Practices, follows a stringent and well organised File Structure and uses React Functional components to recreate multiple components throughout the project. Also, Netlify has been used for free hosting.

<h2> Improve or Change </h2>
The next steps to continue building this into a fully fledged app would be to build a back end application in which you can sign up, sign-in and express interest. This would require a database to host all incoming data, then I would then use the official OpenAI API to then link to this project to create a fully functional clone.
